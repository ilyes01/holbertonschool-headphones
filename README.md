# holbertonschool-headphones
This is a web development project as a Holbertonschool student. The project includes the creation of a landing page for a fictional headphones company. The page includes a header, "What we do..." section, "Our results" section, Contact us form, and a footer.

### Prerequisites
Figma account (design details available in the Figma file)
Fonts source-sans-pro and Spin-Cycle-OT (can be downloaded if missing on computer)
### Important Notes
The web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less
The links hover/active color is #FF6565
The button hover/active opacity is 0.9
The maximum width of the content is 1000px, centered in the page
### Tasks
#### 1. Header
Create the header/hero piece of the landing page. Assets needed can be found in the archive images_0x09.zip.

#### 2. "What we do..." section
Copy the files from the previous task and create the "What we do..." section. Custom font icons are needed and can be found in the archive holberton_school-icon.zip along with a demo page on how to use it.

#### 3. "Our results" section
Copy the files from the previous task and create the "Our results" section, reusing components from the previous task if necessary.

#### 4. Contact us
Copy the files from the previous task and create a contact form, with the option to add any animations and/or constraints on fields.

#### 5. Footer
Copy the files from the previous task and create the footer for the landing page.

#### 6. Replace background image with code
In the "Our results" section, replace the background image with HTML and CSS code to draw each pentagon without the use of an image file.

### CSS and HTML structure recommendations
Use reset CSS styling
Use variables
Simple and generic CSS selectors
Simple HTML structure, using div containers
### Additional advice
When building the web page, it is recommended to start from the outside and move inward, from top to bottom. This will help in structuring the implementation of components and avoid getting lost in HTML tags.
